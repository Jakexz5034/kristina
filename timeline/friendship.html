                <p>This is the first time we ever went to the beach together. It’s also the first time you’ve done it ifykyk 😉. It was really fun, it was the first time I’ve gotten to take you far. I wish I could’ve taken you to see my Mom’s house, maybe one day you will.

                <p>This was the first time I’ve gotten to take you out alone. The first time we actually went on a date. I got you flowers (lego) and took you out for sushi. We also got boba after 😁. I can’t wait to take you out for many more dates. Hopefully by the time you see this we will have gone on plenty more dates.
